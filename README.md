# SF6Scraper
In Development open source web application for scraping and displaying Street Fighter 6 profile data from https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/.

As of right now, this project is very unfinished, but you can access a demo at https://www.brodieberger.com/streetfighter/. The site is still a work in progress so expect things to either be slow or crash often. If you are scanning a new user, expect it to take up to a minute to process.
